# Hi there ðŸ‘‹, I'm Sanket Kumar!  
I am currently 3rd year BS-MS student at Department of Physical Sciences, Indian Institute of Science Education and Research, Kolkata.

I'm still honing my skills in basic Machine Learning, as well as programming with C, C++ and Python. I have some experience with LaTeX, primarily in creating scientific documents, presentations, or typesetting mathematical content.

I also play cricket for fun. hehe ðŸ˜œ
